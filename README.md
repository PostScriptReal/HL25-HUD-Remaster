# HL25 HUD Remaster
This repository contains all the source files for my remaster of Half-Life's HUD, including unused variations and sprites that I never included in the final product.
## License terms
If you are planning to make your own changes to my HUD remaster, you will have to follow the rules set by the MIT license (it's a software license but I don't care, it works), if you don't understand what the terms are or you cannot be bothered to read it, here's a summary of what you can and can't do:

**YOU CAN**

- Make modifications to the HUD using my artwork here and distribute said modification, you also don't need to release your modified version of the source files unless you really want to.
- You can use this for commercial use, so if you really felt like it, you can make your modded version of my HUD remaster paid (though why would you do that, you cretin).

**YOU CANNOT**

- Redistribute the source files OR the mod without the included license.
- You cannot redistribute without any credit, the license makes this work copyrighted in a sense, so the least I can expect out of you for using my work is keeping the copyright notice intact and crediting me for the artwork you've used.

That is all.

## Software used
I used the following software for these source files, I recommend you have the same programs if you want to make changes (if not then use a program that can read the files present here):

- Inkscape (.svg files)
- GIMP (Raster images & .xcf save files)
- Spritemaker (.spr file conversion, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO MANUALLY CONVERT THE FILES TO THE CORRECT FORMATS)
- Half-Life Asset Manager (Model screenshots, though any model viewer for Half-Life can do this)

## READ THIS BEFORE MODIFYING
Most of the svg files seen here are based off of the sprites used at 720p-1440p, so if you are making modifications to the files except for the weapon select sprites, crossbow bolt icon and Snark icon, you can export them directly for 720p and higher. You will need to change the resolution it exports to if you are going to make the same change to the 2K version of the sprite (which I'm sure you'll be doing).
